    "UFC may be the new king of the fight game, and I'm here for it. With megastars like Conor McGregor, Jorge Masvidal, Brock Lesnar, and Ronda Rousey commanding over a million PPVs each, the combat sport is cementing its place amoungest the heavyweights. In the past few years the sport has undergone a transformation similar its president Dana White, going from dweeby dodgeball reject to glossy action flick star. \n",

    "I can't even remember what I used to do on saturday nights, but now I crowd around the TV with my friends as we each loudly predict which fighter will win. Just when you thought UFC was for the muscle-bound monster truck bunch, you find out it is really for the nerds. \n",
