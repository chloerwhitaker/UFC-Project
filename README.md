# UFC Fight Predictor Project

## About the Project

### Project Goals

### Data Dictionary

A list of the variables in the dataframe and their meaning. 

| Variable       | Description                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|                |                                     | 

### Steps to Reproduce

### The Plan

- Wrangle
    - Create a df for the bouts only that lists only bout stats
    - Create a df for the first fighter with all of their stats
    - Create a df for the second fighter with all of their stats
    - Merge all three dfs together
    - Split
    - Initial Questions: 
- Explore
    - Make new columns with the difference between the two fighter's stats
    - Do corr test to see what columns corr to the target (outcome)
    - Flush out two specific fighters to make a compelling story of what drives winning or losing
        - Covington vs Masvidal 
            - Break down their stats for their last (at least 3 fights)
            - Compare their current stats side-by-side to predict who will win their big grudge match
            - Use visuals and statits to do this
- Model
    - Develop classification model that will predict the outcomes of future fight cards
- Refine (Report)
- Deliver
